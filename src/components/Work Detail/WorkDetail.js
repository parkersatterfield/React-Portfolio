To do this, we needed to get their old data, convert it into SQL data, and spin them up a client database. At the time, it seemed like there was no way to easily (or freely) do this - so I offered to build something. By looking at the XML nodes, you can determine what the table names, column names, and data types should be. I built this with C# and hooked it up to the local environment and manually sent the .bat file. After building that, I wanted to build an interface for it and publish it for others to use. I used React for the interface, and after deciding that giving users create database access to my server was a horrible idea without at least building a login, I decided to take a different approach and just output a sql file with the commands that I was going to run on the server. This simplified the project quite a bit, but I am happy with how it turned out.'
